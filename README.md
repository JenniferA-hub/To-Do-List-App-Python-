# To-Do-List-App-Python-

This code makes use of python to create an To Do List app, that allows for the user to input various "To Do" Items and store it within variables in Python This is currently the backend version, and doesn't have a frontend interface as yet This code was also made to be an exercise to understand how to optimize Python code, and to understand varrious functions and methods in Python. Optimizing code includes: -The use of defining functions to replace repeated code -Making use of different functions that will not slow down the system,as the code is produced. -Making the code as short as possible,whilst making it as userfriendly as possible. -The use of for loops,while loops and code breaks to reduce redundancies,and reduce processing power when code runs
